    <h1>Hi, I'm Mikita Martynau</h1>
    
    <p>I help B2B SaaS startups find their footing and grow. I’ve founded Skarbe and was previously a Product Director at PandaDoc. My goal is to help you build products that users love and that scale smoothly.</p>

    <h2>What I Can Help With:</h2>

    <div class="challenge" onclick="toggle('pmf')">► Figuring Out Product-Market Fit</div>
    <div class="solution" id="pmf">
        At my current startup, we made three big changes in six months to align with what users actually wanted, which led to 20+ active users and 3 paying customers. At PandaDoc, I refined our product approach to drive 150% growth each year.
    </div>

    <div class="challenge" onclick="toggle('mvp')">► Building MVPs That Get Early Users</div>
    <div class="solution" id="mvp">
        I secured 9 design partners within 3 months of launching our MVP, and 3 of them became paying customers. I developed a fast way to prototype, which cut our time to get a first user by half.
    </div>

    <div class="challenge" onclick="toggle('scale')">► Scaling Products Efficiently</div>
    <div class="solution" id="scale">
        At PandaDoc, I helped scale from a small team to a company with $100M+ in ARR over 4 years. We expanded from 1 to 5 main products without losing focus on our core customers.
    </div>

    <div class="challenge" onclick="toggle('acquisition')">► Improving Customer Acquisition</div>
    <div class="solution" id="acquisition">
        I used product-led growth tactics at PandaDoc that reduced our customer acquisition costs by 30% and increased user activation from 20% to 35% in just one year.
    </div>

    <h2>My Approach:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data-Driven Decisions:</strong> I base every decision on actual user feedback and market research.</li>
        <li><strong>Fast Iteration:</strong> We work in short cycles, adjusting quickly based on what we learn.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaborative Leadership:</strong> I work closely with product, engineering, and sales teams to make sure everyone is moving in the same direction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How I Can Work With You:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Interim CPO:</strong> Stepping in to lead product for a few months.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic Advice:</strong> Helping shape your product strategy and team structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Growth Consultation:</strong> Finding ways to grow through both product and sales tactics.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Let's talk if you're trying to get your product off the ground or need help scaling up. I'm here to share what I've learned and help you succeed.</p>
