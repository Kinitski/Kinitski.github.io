    <h1>Your Interim CPO: Building B2B SaaS Products That Find Customers Fast</h1>
    
    <p>I'm Mikita Martynau, a product leader with experience scaling B2B SaaS from the ground up to achieving significant growth milestones. I am currently founding Skarbe and was previously a Product Director at PandaDoc, a company that achieved unicorn status.</p>

    <h2>Key Challenges I Solve:</h2>

    <div class="challenge" onclick="toggle('pmf')">► Finding Product-Market Fit</div>
    <div class="solution" id="pmf">
        I help startups identify what users really want and adapt their products quickly. At my current startup, I led several strategic pivots to better align with market needs, turning initial concepts into valuable customer insights. At PandaDoc, I refined our approach to consistently align our product with market demand, driving substantial growth.

    <div class="challenge" onclick="toggle('mvp')">► Building MVPs That Attract Early Adopters</div>
    <div class="solution" id="mvp">
        I specialize in creating MVPs that resonate with early adopters by focusing on core functionalities that matter most. By collaborating closely with design partners and rapidly iterating on feedback, I developed a streamlined prototyping process that brings products to market faster and meets real user needs.
    </div>

    <div class="challenge" onclick="toggle('scale')">► Scaling Product for Growth</div>
    <div class="solution" id="scale">
        At PandaDoc, I played a key role in scaling the company from an early-stage startup to a major player in the SaaS space, expanding our product suite while maintaining a strong focus on customer retention and satisfaction.
    </div>

        I develop growth strategies that reduce customer acquisition costs and increase user engagement. By refining the onboarding process and enhancing product value, I’ve helped companies improve user activation rates and retain customers more effectively.

        <li><strong>Cross-Functional Leadership:</strong> I align product, engineering, and go-to-market teams to ensure everyone is working towards the same goals.</li>
