    <h1>Mikita Martynau: I've Been There, I Can Help</h1>
    
    <p>Hey founders, I know the startup journey is tough. I've been through it, and I'm here to help. Click on each challenge to see how we can tackle it together:</p>

    <div class="challenge" onclick="toggle('solution1')">► "I built a product, but no one seems to care."</div>
    <div class="solution" id="solution1">Been there. Let's dig into what your customers really need and align your product with those needs. We'll set up customer interviews, analyze feedback, and iterate quickly.</div>

    <div class="challenge" onclick="toggle('solution2')">► "Getting customers is harder than I thought."</div>
    <div class="solution" id="solution2">It's not just about the product. We'll work on identifying your ideal customer, crafting a message that resonates, and setting up a sales process that actually works.</div>

    <div class="challenge" onclick="toggle('solution3')">► "We're growing, but everything's breaking."</div>
    <div class="solution" id="solution3">Growth is good, but it needs to be managed. I can help set up processes that scale, prioritize the right features, and build a team that can handle the pressure.</div>

    <div class="challenge" onclick="toggle('solution4')">► "I'm constantly putting out fires instead of moving forward."</div>
    <div class="solution" id="solution4">Time management is crucial. We'll establish priorities, delegate effectively, and create systems that let you focus on what really matters for your startup's success.</div>

    <p>I've been a founder, an early startup employee, and led product at PandaDoc from early-stage to unicorn. I understand your challenges because I've lived them.</p>

    <p>Available for hands-on help, strategic advice, or just a conversation about your startup. Let's work together to turn your vision into reality.</p>
